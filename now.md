# What I'm doing Now
<small class="text-muted">(inspired by [Derek Sivers](http://nownownow.com/))</small>

* My career
* Figuring out adult life as a new grad (December 2016) and a married woman (April 2017)
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214334-stevie-oberg)
* Writing

__These are my main priorities right now.__

I am open to considering new opportunities as I'm eager to learn and grow in my field.
