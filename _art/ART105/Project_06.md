This was a prompt given to me in art class to design an album cover for a chosen selection of albums. I chose __Barbara, Barbara, Weâ€™re Facing a Shining Future__ by Underworld. We were also given the following requirements:
- Design was to be in vinyl format (12" x 12")
- No text could be used
- Design could not reflect or resemble the current album cover

# My thoughts
When listening to this album I got a vibe of peaceful chaos that I wanted to embody that in my design. I was especially inspired by two of their music videos: [Exhale]() and [If Rah](). My color scheme was inspired by their music video for __Exhale__ and I used the dancer from __If Rah__ for the creation of the image.
