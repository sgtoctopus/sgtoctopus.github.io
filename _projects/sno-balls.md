# About
This was the last assignment given for Web Design 2. It's focus was on texture.

## Purpose
- Thoughtful analysis of the siteâ€™s target audience, tone, and goals
- Thoughtful use of background imagery as a design element throughout, in keeping with the audience, tone, & goals
- Horizontal navigation (using clean, standard code, and live text)
- Change of background image on the hover state of the main navigation links
- Use of background images in other parts of the design, and tiling where needed

## Requirements
- Main navigation had to have background images on the hover
- At least 3 background images in the design

# Thoughts
I'm extremely proud of what I accomplished with this site. Almost everything was accomplished using css (javascript was used for the color changing backgrounds on the menu page). This project taught me what can be accomplished in web with very little programming.
