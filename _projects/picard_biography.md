# About
This was the first assignment given for Web Design 1. It was meant as an experiment with typography.

## Purpose
- Design with typography for the best user experience
- Learn the fundamentals of web fonts
- Site set-up basics

## Requirements
- We were given a list of HTML tags and CSS styles to use
- Use 2-3 Web Fonts
- Use Primarily grayscale, with no more than one additional color

# Thoughts
I enjoyed the challenge of making a page interesting using only typography. However, I did bend the rules by using a _bluescale_ rather than a _grayscale_ (a choice that made my teacher laugh and forgive the deviation as it was still within the spirit of the project).

If I were to change anything, I would have liked to add star streaks to the background just to give it that extra trekkie feel.
