# The Problem
The _Teaching and Learning Center_ (TLC) of UW-Parkside was having a tough time guiding students through a specialized certificate called _Global Skills Certificate_ FLEX Option (GSC) and a mess of Excel Sheets. GSC provided a way for students to customize their learning experience, but TLC had no way to help them visualize the experiences they achieved.

Our job was to create an interactive web tool to give students the ability to design their GSC.

# The Solution
This Web Tool was created using [Highcharts API](https://www.highcharts.com/), MySQL Database, PHP, and Bootstrap.

## Front-End
A radar graph was the perfect way to describe the growth among the different skills a student would acquire through the classes eligible for GLC, so we used the Highcharts API to display a graph and in order to create a clean look we used Bootstrap.

## Back-End
Our client made it very clear to us they wanted this project to be scalable. We spent many hours discussing future plans and possibilities for this application, so we set up a MySQL Database to hold all the content that could manipulate the graph. And used PHP to bridge the front and back ends together.

## The Process
We built this application using the Waterfall Method, which gave me experience writing Design, Requirements, and Testing Documents. During our semester working on this project we held regular meetings with our client to keep our Documents on track with their vision.

# Lessons Learned
This was the first real team project I ever worked on so there was a lot of learning for me to do. Some of the major lessons involved time and team management.
